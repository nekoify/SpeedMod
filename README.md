**These are the current features available in version 1.0.0 of SpeedMod:**

## Speed display

The current velocity of the player can be displayed with 2 main elements:
- **Speed Bar**: An orange bar at the top of the screen that expands according to the player's current velocity;
- **Speed Text**: The floating value of the player's current velocity (from 0 to 42);

## Manual checkpoints

A total of **3 manual checkpoints** can be set by the player, by default:
- `F2`, `F3` and `F4` will set the first, second and third checkpoint;
- `2`, `3` and `4` will load the first, second and third checkpoint;
- `Z` will reset the 3 checkpoints.

# Installation

In order to use this mod, you first need to [install MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader.Installer/blob/master/README.md#how-to-install-re-install-or-update-melonloader).

There are 2 methods to install the mod from here:  

### Quick way

You can simply copy the `SpeedMod.dll` from the Releases page inside the `YOUR_GAME_DIR/Mods/` folder, and run the game!  

### Build from source
You can also build the project yourself by cloning the repository, and building with dotnet:  
```powershell

### Troubleshooting

For the BepinEx release, if the mod doesn't start, you can set `HideManagerGameObject = true` in the `BepinEx/config/BepinEx.cfg` file.
